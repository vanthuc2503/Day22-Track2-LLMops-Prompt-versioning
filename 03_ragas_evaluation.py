"""
Step 3 — RAGAS Evaluation
===========================
TASK:
  1. Run all 50 QA pairs through BOTH prompt versions, capturing answers + contexts
  2. Build EvaluationDataset with SingleTurnSample objects
  3. Evaluate with 4 RAGAS metrics: faithfulness, answer_relevancy,
     context_recall, context_precision
  4. Print a V1 vs V2 comparison table
  5. Save results to data/ragas_report.json

DELIVERABLE: faithfulness ≥ 0.8 for at least one prompt version
             + data/ragas_report.json file saved

⏰ NOTE: This step takes ~20-30 minutes. Start it early!
